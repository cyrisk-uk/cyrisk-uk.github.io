Cyber Essentials User FAQ
======

This pages contains an FAQ designed for organisations which are deploying Cyber Essentials to share with their users.
Since every organisation will choose how to meet the Cyber Essentials requirements and will potentially start from different points you are very likely to need to edit for your situation, but hopefully this will provide a useful starting point.
This FAQ was originally created for an organisation controlling laptops with Microsoft Endpoint Manager and BYOD mobile devices using Mobile Application Management (MAM).

It's not clear why this is not formatting as expected
