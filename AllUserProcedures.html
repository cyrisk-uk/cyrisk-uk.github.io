      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>**Organisation** needs to operate in a manner which demonstrates that physical, technical and personnel risks are adequately controlled. This allows clients to trust **Organisation** to deliver engagements which involve handing client data and ensures that **Organisation** meets data protection and other legislative requirements.
Users will be required to acknowledge this document before they are issued with a device or user account. All users will be required to repeat the acknowledgement on an annual basis or when there is a change to the document which is material to the user responsibilities.
</p>
      <h1>Client Data</h1>
      <p>The following rules must be followed at all times, if you believe that you need to break any of these rules to deliver a client or business requirement you must escalate this to **Document Owner**.
        <ul>
          <li>Client data must only be stored on organisation approved laptops or organisation provided online storage</li>
          <ul>
            <li>All organistion approved End User Devices(EUDs) must comply with the Cyber Essentials technical requirements, which includes at rest encryption and user authentication.</li>
            <li>All organisation approved online storage will be located in the UK and use unique user identities and multi-factor authentication.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Client data must be stored in engagement specific areas of organisation provided online storage, so access is restricted to those users with a valid need to know and automatically backed up.</li>
          <li>Any requests to add users to engagement areas of online storage must be approved by the Director in Charge for the engagement.</li>
          <li>Client data will only be transmitted using encrypted mechanisms, only these mechanisms are available for organisation provided online storage. The use of email needs to be agreed in writing with the client or approved by **Document Owner**.</li>
          <li>Client data must not be stored or exchanged on removable media.</li>
          <li>If necessary, offline backups which include client data must be robustly encrypted and kept in company approved physically secure storage.</li>
          <li>Paper copies of client data should not be created unless you can store them securely or destroy them at the end of the working day.</li>
          <li>Paper documents must be destroyed using cross-cut shredders.</li>
          <li>Client data is provided for specific engagements so you must not use it for another engagement with the same client, without first seeking advice from **Document Owner**.</li>
          <li>Client data held electronically should never normally be requested by clients, because they already hold the data. If you receive such a request this must be referred to **Document Owner** prior to responding to the requestor.</li>
          <li>Any requests to release client data (including Subject Access Requests, Freedom of Information Act and Legislative Requests) held by **Organisation** to any party must be referred to the **Document Owner** prior to responding to the requestor or notifying the client.</li>
